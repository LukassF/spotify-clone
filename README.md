## General info
Music-app is a music streaming and music data manipulation programme that is similar to Spotify. It offers all of the normal Spotify capabilities, including the ability to play music, make playlists, and listen to albums by favourite artists. Make sure you have a premium Spotify account though, as the free version of the app does not support music streaming. 

## Additional info
Due to the Spotify privacy policy the app powering this project has to remain in development mode, and thus cannot be publically used. That however only concerns the augmented version of the application, available after logging in to your Spotify Premium account through the login page on this website. The free version of the app is public, but bear in mind, it has limited capabilities. Because of the app being in development mode, upon logging in, an error will occur. To prevent this, before logging in, send me an email with your full name, surname and email, and I will grant you access to the app. After receiving a reply from me you should be free to login.
